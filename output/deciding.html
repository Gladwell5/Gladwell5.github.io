</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I've been in the situation a few times where I sought advice on big decisions from different people - family, friends, etc. with mixed success. Therapists can be helpful because they are outside your circle - they're paid to focus on you and your best interests - but they also don't know you and probably won't still be there when/if things go tits-up.</p>
<p>I reckon decisions have three phases. The first is in the heart (knowing what you want), the second is in the head (deciding what to do) and the third is in the action (actually doing it).</p>
<p>The vast majority of time, the advice I got wasn't useful in itself but my reaction to it was. You may not feel you know yourself well but no one else can feel your gut reactions. Those are a clue to your raw emotions and once you have that gut reaction, others can help with the second stage of thinking about the implications and consequences.</p>
<p>Then it's back to you for following through on the action. Lacking the courage or willingness to act on a decision that has already been made in your guts and in your head begets unhappiness.</p>
