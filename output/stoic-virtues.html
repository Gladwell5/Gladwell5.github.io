</p>      <p>I find it helpful to ask what the opposite of a virtue would look like. What would I do if I acted unjustly? Judging the actions of people I don't know, ignoring pleas for help, killing a spider because I don't like them, buying/using products that I know hurt others or the environment. These are just examples that come to my mind. I think justice is the hardest of the virtues to practice because it requires not only an examination of your thoughts and actions but of the methods that you use to assess their fairness.</p>
<p>I think it's bigger than kindness. It is also patience, clemency, acceptance of others including how they differ from you. And it is not just for the people you see every day but all people, all animals, now, in the past and in the future. If life is unfair then every time the decision falls to us to make it fairer, we should take it.</p>
<p>Cowardice is bound up with fears of the consequences of my actions. Lying to protect myself is a cowardly act. Staying in a job/family/situation that I don't like can be cowardly, because even though it looks like inaction, it is a decision every day to stay. Courage is I think an acceptance of the consequences that follow an action that you know or feel to be the right one - acting in accordance with how you feel so the external reflects the internal.</p>
