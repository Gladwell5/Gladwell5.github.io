</p>      <p>I think it's important to distinguish between soliloquies (including asides) and monologues.</p>
<p>My experience is that soliloquies and asides are meant for the audience.</p>
<p>In general, I do pick out a specific person (or people if it's a long one) because I think it feels more engaging and private. I like to think of those inner thoughts as secrets shared with the audience, so feel that delivering over heads is best kept for talking about a memory or something so personal that not even the audience should be hearing it, these moments are very rare though.</p>
<p>Monologues are a different animal because other characters are usually on the stage and actively listening. I always think of monologues as a conversation in which one person is talking, the others may (and should) still have a lot to contribute in the form of postures, expressions, actions and maybe interjections. The other actors should seize these opportunities to do the most appropriate thing but the speaking actor must give them enough to work with and that is hard if the actor speaks outward into the auditorium. What you are left with is an audience in front and behind who simply watch while you speak, a nice feeling for an actor who has worked hard on a speech but not necessarily the way to beat serve the story.</p>
<p>Read the Porter's speech from Macbeth for a great soliloquy that would lose so much if it did not seek to engage the audience.</p>
<p>Read also A Slight Ache by Pinter. There are scenes many minutes long with one speaking and one silent character, which must be read and interpreted as a conversation.</p>
