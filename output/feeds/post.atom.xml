It took them a while to find their place because Syd Barrett was the leader early on and he certainly wasn’t as articulate or serious as Waters could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they seem indulgent, it’s possibly because they came from jazz/blues and since improvising is a big part of that, they kept that vibe alive throughout their work. There are definitely songs of theirs that are indulgent but I still love the likes of Echoes, Astronomy Domine, Shine On, Sheep. The most indulgent stuff was early on (Syd Barrett) and later with Dave Gilmour as leader. Their last album was unbearable and you can ignore most (all?) of what happened after The Final Cut because Roger Waters was the main creative force of the Pink Floyd that most fans loved. Of course the others also made huge contributions but the drive to say something important was his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waters was in charge when they had their sound figured out on the likes of Dark Side, The Wall, Animals, Wish You Were Here and The Final Cut. Albums like Meddle are also great but they were a waypoint, something the band had to pass through to get there. Meddle is a mix of standard rock ballads and a long experimental song that I really like. I could have it on repeat for hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nostalgia is also important because the impact of say Dark Side was so much more in 1973 than it would have been today. This was years after the 60s bands changed music forever and it was hard to find something new. Pink Floyd did with Dark Side what The Beatles did with Sgt. Pepper and The White Album, or The Beach Boys with Pet Sounds and Smile - instead of just collating songs to make an album, they took a broader concept for an album and broke it up into songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink Floyd’s 5 major albums are closer to a novel or movie (The Wall literally is a movie) in my mind because they have coherent themes (mostly) that run through them and the music is varied yet consistent. I only listen to these Pink Floyd albums all the way through and never on shuffle. To pull out Another Brick in the Wall pt. 2 or Wish You Were Here is like yanking a chapter from a book and expecting it to stand alone. Which it kind of can but you lose so much context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course you might just dislike what they do. All I can say is I love the sound, the lyrics, the composition, the linking of ideas and themes, the experimentation, and of course the bands and albums that undoubtedly exist thanks to them. They were unique.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Post"></category></entry><entry><title>Stoic Virtues</title><link href="https://gladwell5.github.io/stoic-virtues.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-02-18T12:41:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-18T12:41:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Gladwell5</name></author><id>tag:gladwell5.github.io,2024-02-18:/stoic-virtues.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I find it helpful to ask what the opposite of a virtue would look like.

What would I do if I acted unjustly? Judging the actions of people I don't know, ignoring pleas for help, killing a spider because I don't like them, buying/using products that I know hurt others or the environment. These are just examples that come to my mind. I think justice is the hardest of the virtues to practice because it requires not only an examination of your thoughts and actions but of the methods that you use to assess their fairness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's bigger than kindness. It is also patience, clemency, acceptance of others including how they differ from you. And it is not just for the people you see every day but all people, all animals, now, in the past and in the future. If life is unfair then every time the decision falls to us to make it fairer, we should take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cowardice is bound up with fears of the consequences of my actions. Lying to protect myself is a cowardly act. Staying in a job/family/situation that I don't like can be cowardly, because even though it looks like inaction, it is a decision every day to stay. Courage is I think an acceptance of the consequences that follow an action that you know or feel to be the right one - acting in accordance with how you feel so the external reflects the internal.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Post"></category></entry><entry><title>Cat and Dog</title><link href="https://gladwell5.github.io/cat-and-dog.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-30T06:24:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-30T06:24:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Gladwell5</name></author><id>tag:gladwell5.github.io,2023-08-30:/cat-and-dog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cat fights dog.

&lt;p&gt;Training models is very expensive and time-consuming and we weren't totally sure how well it would work to keep doing what we'd been doing. OpenAI pushed ahead with this idea of bigger and bigger models and spent millions on it and eventually trained GPT-3, which was surprisingly good at generating text compared to earlier models. Once they proved that approach worked, everyone else knew it too and they could be more sure that they would have something to show for their money. That's the economic bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alignment bit is that OpenAI did a whole additional training process (with humans in the loop) on GPT-3 to turn it into ChatGPT. GPT-3 could do one thing - generate follow-on text from a starting prompt. With ChatGPT, we saw that prompts could be anything - questions, instructions, etc. and the model can be adjusted to generate in a way that responds to the prompt (rather than just continue on). This made certain language understanding/processing/generation tasks massively more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a large instructable general model, the user gets to decide (at prompt time) what they want to do with it instead of needing to pick and train a single smaller model per task in advance. Obviously this depends on the task, typically the more specific a model is, the better it performs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically OpenAI spent the money and effort to prove you could make a model like ChatGPT and they shared the process so anyone could (in theory) do the same. At that point, people could begin looking at ways to make it faster, cheaper and better and they could use GPT (or specific tests) to benchmark the performance and understand more about what matters most in the training process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Once the first really impressive model was made, we were surer about the right process and that knowledge spread fast.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Post"></category></entry><entry><title>MTV Days</title><link href="https://gladwell5.github.io/mtv-days.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-03T10:24:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-03T10:24:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Gladwell5</name></author><id>tag:gladwell5.github.io,2022-01-03:/mtv-days.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Land of Confusion - Genesis

One thing I've noticed from writing is that I usually have a particular way of saying a line in my head, maybe not the gestures but almost always the facial expression and intonation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, actors will put their own spin on those things and it almost never looks as I thought it would. Sometimes better, sometimes worse, but 99% of the time it's different. The spin you put on those lines is what makes you interesting as an actor - think of the most successful actors, even playing a very particular character, they have inflections and phrasing that are all their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I make marks on a text it's usually to remind me of my preferred pacing and stress so that I hit the important parts of the speech. Find the big lines, find the 'filler' lines, look for things that may not be said, look for things that maybe were said and shouldn't have been, and figure out how to make the 1 or 2 most important things stand out for someone who will only see the play once and want to follow the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really simple stuff can totally change a scene. I was watching a Pinter play called Betrayal and one of the characters had the line 'Do you think we'll ever go to Venice?' The scene up to that point was about the other character visiting Venice with his lover so the line is probably "Do you think WE'LL ever go to Venice?" implying that she wants to go with him, maybe to create new memories so he'll shut up about his prior visit with an old flame. What the actor said was "Do you think we'll EVER go to Venice?" implying she's weary of wanting to go and this has come up before. I suspect the former is the way Pinter intended, the latter works too but only if it serves the story as the director intends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the length.

&lt;p&gt;We have energy alternatives (if only we would commit to them) and birth rates (depending on the country) are low. Supply chains are a problem for sure but if we try to buy foods with a shorter journey to our door and prefer existing secondhand goods to new, those issues will ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's this fear (particularly with a pandemic in the mix) that we're all fucked and there's nothing we can do so why bother. Well there are things we can do but we (governments and business owners in particular but also the people who will put pressure on them) have to be brave to do them because it will involve a fundamental shift from what seemed to work in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are still learning how to manage and organise large numbers of ourselves. It's all very new and we've blown up so many economies in our short history that it's clear sustainability was never a priority. Now it has to be. We've gotten used to being impatient and preferring the new over the old, never looking more than a few years ahead (the time governments are typically in power). Now we must think much further ahead and it's scary but it is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Post"></category></entry><entry><title>Work</title><link href="https://gladwell5.github.io/work.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-17T13:24:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-09-17T13:24:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Gladwell5</name></author><id>tag:gladwell5.github.io,2019-09-17:/work.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ann, Bob and Charlie built a wall in 4 hours.

However, Ann had to leaave after 2 hours, and Bob arrived an hour late then left an hour early. So hour 1 had 2 people, hour 2 had all 3, hour 3 had 2 people, and the last hour just had 1. The (average) people per hour working on the wall was (2+3+2+1)/4 = 2, but the people-hours is just the numerator, 2+3+2+1 = 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd worked alone, it's still 8 people-hours to build the wall but the people per hour would be 1 (for 8 hours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Ann and Bob were there the whole time, again it still takes 8 person-hours but now it's 3 people per hour (for 2 hrs 40 mins).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People-hours is the total work done and tells you how much effort something takes regardless of how fast you do it. People per hour is the rate of work - it does tell you how fast you work but not for how long or the total effort involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Repeat step 8 for each egg, no need to rush as if you cook about 4-6 eggs, the first will be ready shortly after the last one has gone in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check on the eggs frequently using a slotted spoon. Lift one up and poke the centre, once the white around the yolk feels slightly firm take that egg out and put it on a plate with some paper towels underneath to absorb any water. Each egg takes about 2 mins but will vary by egg size, water temp, etc. so knowing the right moment to take them out takes a bit of experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The eggs should be the last thing you do, toast, tea, etc. should all be ready as you need to serve them immediately. Once they're on the serving plate, stab with a knife to open them up and stop the cooking. I put salt and pepper on top.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience is that soliloquies and asides are meant for the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I do pick out a specific person (or people if it's a long one) because I think it feels more engaging and private. I like to think of those inner thoughts as secrets shared with the audience, so feel that delivering over heads is best kept for talking about a memory or something so personal that not even the audience should be hearing it, these moments are very rare though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monologues are a different animal because other characters are usually on the stage and actively listening. I always think of monologues as a conversation in which one person is talking, the others may (and should) still have a lot to contribute in the form of postures, expressions, actions and maybe interjections. The other actors should seize these opportunities to do the most appropriate thing but the speaking actor must give them enough to work with and that is hard if the actor speaks outward into the auditorium. What you are left with is an audience in front and behind who simply watch while you speak, a nice feeling for an actor who has worked hard on a speech but not necessarily the way to beat serve the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Porter's speech from Macbeth for a great soliloquy that would lose so much if it did not seek to engage the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read also A Slight Ache by Pinter.

&lt;p&gt;Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (Pirsig).
Not much to say about this, widely known and read for its accessible philosophical musings. Great to read at crisis points in life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Post"></category></entry><entry><title>Child Me</title><link href="https://gladwell5.github.io/child-me.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-19T11:14:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-06-19T11:14:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Gladwell5</name></author><id>tag:gladwell5.github.io,2017-06-19:/child-me.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to remember every little detail, and kids’ plans and dreams change daily.

To live up to that would mean doing so many things halfway, that nothing would be firm enough to say “yes I am that” or “I did that”. So I suppose I didn't live up to what younger me wanted. Reason is I had to make choices, to say yes to one thing, no to another, and take on responsibilities as a fellow human - for others and for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regrets grow during life crises, and as someone who’s currently deep in their mid-life crisis, I’ve tried to accept the past and look at what I can do from this point on. I’m sure I have regrets as I look back from today but that doesn’t mean that I was forced into anything at the time. Over the years, I was fortunate to be able to take the path I wanted at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two lyrics stick with me on this stuff:
“Your heart, it aches for the lives that you will never lead. We come and go but someday I will find the time.” Slow Club&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ten decisions shape your life, you’ll be aware of five about.” The Strokes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think kid me might be disappointed but he’s a kid. I would hope that he would seek to empathise, understand and help me plan my next move, not be a little whiney bitch about why I’m not a rockstar.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Post"></category></entry></feed>
