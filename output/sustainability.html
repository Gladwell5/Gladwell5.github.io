</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I think fear perpetuates these problems. It's why those with a lot to lose are going into space and the rest of us are so anxious.</p>
<p>We have energy alternatives (if only we would commit to them) and birth rates (depending on the country) are low. Supply chains are a problem for sure but if we try to buy foods with a shorter journey to our door and prefer existing secondhand goods to new, those issues will ease.</p>
<p>There's this fear (particularly with a pandemic in the mix) that we're all fucked and there's nothing we can do so why bother. Well there are things we can do but we (governments and business owners in particular but also the people who will put pressure on them) have to be brave to do them because it will involve a fundamental shift from what seemed to work in the past.</p>
<p>Humans are still learning how to manage and organise large numbers of ourselves. It's all very new and we've blown up so many economies in our short history that it's clear sustainability was never a priority. Now it has to be. We've gotten used to being impatient and preferring the new over the old, never looking more than a few years ahead (the time governments are typically in power). Now we must think much further ahead and it's scary but it is necessary.</p>
