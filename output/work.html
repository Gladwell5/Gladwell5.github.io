</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Ann, Bob and Charlie built a wall in 4 hours. However, Ann had to leaave after 2 hours, and Bob arrived an hour late then left an hour early. So hour 1 had 2 people, hour 2 had all 3, hour 3 had 2 people, and the last hour just had 1. The (average) people per hour working on the wall was (2+3+2+1)/4 = 2, but the people-hours is just the numerator, 2+3+2+1 = 8.</p>
<p>If you'd worked alone, it's still 8 people-hours to build the wall but the people per hour would be 1 (for 8 hours).</p>
<p>If Ann and Bob were there the whole time, again it still takes 8 person-hours but now it's 3 people per hour (for 2 hrs 40 mins).</p>
<p>People-hours is the total work done and tells you how much effort something takes regardless of how fast you do it. People per hour is the rate of work - it does tell you how fast you work but not for how long or the total effort involved.</p>
<p>One other example (because money makes everything realer): it's the difference between the average amount of cash you spend per day and how much you've spent in total by the end of the month.</p>
