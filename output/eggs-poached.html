<li>Eggs have to be as fresh as you can get.</li>
<li>Eggs have to be room temp so get them out of fridge (if that's where you keep them) an hour or two beforehand.</li>
<li>A wide, shallow pan is better than a small, deep one.</li>
<li>Half fill the pot/pan with water.</li>
<li>Add a splash of vinegar to the water and bring to the boil.</li>
<li>Back off the heat so it's not boiling violently, that will break up your eggs.</li>
<li>Take a small, shallow coffee cup and break an egg into it.</li>
<li>Turn the cup at an angle and slowly lower it into the water, let the water flow gently into the cup. Hold there for about 5 seconds then gently tip the egg into the water.</li>
<li>Repeat step 8 for each egg, no need to rush as if you cook about 4-6 eggs, the first will be ready shortly after the last one has gone in.</li>
<li>Check on the eggs frequently using a slotted spoon. Lift one up and poke the centre, once the white around the yolk feels slightly firm take that egg out and put it on a plate with some paper towels underneath to absorb any water. Each egg takes about 2 mins but will vary by egg size, water temp, etc. so knowing the right moment to take them out takes a bit of experience.</li>
<li>The eggs should be the last thing you do, toast, tea, etc. should all be ready as you need to serve them immediately. Once they're on the serving plate, stab with a knife to open them up and stop the cooking. I put salt and pepper on top.</li>
