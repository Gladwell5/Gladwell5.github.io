</p>      <p>It’s hard to remember every little detail, and kids’ plans and dreams change daily. To live up to that would mean doing so many things halfway, that nothing would be firm enough to say “yes I am that” or “I did that”. So I suppose I didn't live up to what younger me wanted. Reason is I had to make choices, to say yes to one thing, no to another, and take on responsibilities as a fellow human - for others and for myself.</p>
<p>Regrets grow during life crises, and as someone who’s currently deep in their mid-life crisis, I’ve tried to accept the past and look at what I can do from this point on. I’m sure I have regrets as I look back from today but that doesn’t mean that I was forced into anything at the time. Over the years, I was fortunate to be able to take the path I wanted at the time.</p>
<p>Two lyrics stick with me on this stuff:
“Your heart, it aches for the lives that you will never lead. We come and go but someday I will find the time.” Slow Club</p>
<p>“Ten decisions shape your life, you’ll be aware of five about.” The Strokes</p>
<p>I think kid me might be disappointed but he’s a kid. I would hope that he would seek to empathise, understand and help me plan my next move, not be a little whiney bitch about why I’m not a rockstar.</p>
