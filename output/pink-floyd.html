</p>      <p>For me, it was Pink Floyd's commitment to the album as the unit of composition as opposed to the song, plus the fact that they had something to say. It took them a while to find their place because Syd Barrett was the leader early on and he certainly wasn’t as articulate or serious as Waters could be.</p>
<p>If they seem indulgent, it’s possibly because they came from jazz/blues and since improvising is a big part of that, they kept that vibe alive throughout their work. There are definitely songs of theirs that are indulgent but I still love the likes of Echoes, Astronomy Domine, Shine On, Sheep. The most indulgent stuff was early on (Syd Barrett) and later with Dave Gilmour as leader. Their last album was unbearable and you can ignore most (all?) of what happened after The Final Cut because Roger Waters was the main creative force of the Pink Floyd that most fans loved. Of course the others also made huge contributions but the drive to say something important was his.</p>
<p>Waters was in charge when they had their sound figured out on the likes of Dark Side, The Wall, Animals, Wish You Were Here and The Final Cut. Albums like Meddle are also great but they were a waypoint, something the band had to pass through to get there. Meddle is a mix of standard rock ballads and a long experimental song that I really like. I could have it on repeat for hours.</p>
<p>Nostalgia is also important because the impact of say Dark Side was so much more in 1973 than it would have been today. This was years after the 60s bands changed music forever and it was hard to find something new. Pink Floyd did with Dark Side what The Beatles did with Sgt. Pepper and The White Album, or The Beach Boys with Pet Sounds and Smile - instead of just collating songs to make an album, they took a broader concept for an album and broke it up into songs.</p>
<p>Pink Floyd’s 5 major albums are closer to a novel or movie (The Wall literally is a movie) in my mind because they have coherent themes (mostly) that run through them and the music is varied yet consistent. I only listen to these Pink Floyd albums all the way through and never on shuffle. To pull out Another Brick in the Wall pt. 2 or Wish You Were Here is like yanking a chapter from a book and expecting it to stand alone. Which it kind of can but you lose so much context.</p>
<p>Of course you might just dislike what they do. All I can say is I love the sound, the lyrics, the composition, the linking of ideas and themes, the experimentation, and of course the bands and albums that undoubtedly exist thanks to them. They were unique.</p>
