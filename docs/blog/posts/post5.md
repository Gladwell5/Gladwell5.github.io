# Books

Down and Out in Paris and London (Orwell), Tropic of Cancer (Miller), Moveable Feast (Hemingway).
These three for perspectives of life in Paris (and the writers themselves as they are autobiographical) when it was the place to be in the 20s and 30s. 

Catâ€™s Cradle (Vonnegut), Player Piano (Vonnegut).
My favourite Vonnegut novels along with Slaughterhouse 5.

Keep the Aspidistra Flying (Orwell).
My favourite Orwell next to 1984. 1984 is pretty much a perfect novel in my eyes and this is as close as he got with his other efforts. Burmese Days is also worth a read.

My Uncle Oswald (Dahl).
Still not widely known that Dahl wrote stuff for adults. This is great fun, full of sex and so quotable. Read his short stories too. If you want to do it right, read The Visitor and then My Uncle Oswald.

Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (Pirsig).
Not much to say about this, widely known and read for its accessible philosophical musings. Great to read at crisis points in life.
