I'm sure I could think of another 50 that I used to sit and wait for on MTV because someone I knew told me how amazing it was.

Some were really rare - like the 10-min version of Remember the Time with MJ transforming into a black panther - and some were more common - Ironic seemed to be shown every 45 mins.

Watching was like collecting Pokemon, which I never did but I guess that's what it feels like. The next day at school you could go in and brag about how you saw the new Blur video and it was fucking life-changing, and who's that buxom young lady? and where do I know that guy from?

There are some cool videos these days - OK GO for example - but I used to feel lucky to see a great video.
