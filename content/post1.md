Title: Acting

I been acting for about 10 years and starting writing in the last 2-3 years. One thing I've noticed from writing is that I usually have a particular way of saying a line in my head, maybe not the gestures but almost always the facial expression and intonation.

Obviously, actors will put their own spin on those things and it almost never looks as I thought it would. Sometimes better, sometimes worse, but 99% of the time it's different. The spin you put on those lines is what makes you interesting as an actor - think of the most successful actors, even playing a very particular character, they have inflections and phrasing that are all their own.

When I make marks on a text it's usually to remind me of my preferred pacing and stress so that I hit the important parts of the speech. Find the big lines, find the 'filler' lines, look for things that may not be said, look for things that maybe were said and shouldn't have been, and figure out how to make the 1 or 2 most important things stand out for someone who will only see the play once and want to follow the story.

Really simple stuff can totally change a scene. I was watching a Pinter play called Betrayal and one of the characters had the line 'Do you think we'll ever go to Venice?' The scene up to that point was about the other character visiting Venice with his lover so the line is probably "Do you think WE'LL ever go to Venice?" implying that she wants to go with him, maybe to create new memories so he'll shut up about his prior visit with an old flame. What the actor said was "Do you think we'll EVER go to Venice?" implying she's weary of wanting to go and this has come up before. I suspect the former is the way Pinter intended, the latter works too but only if it serves the story as the director intends.

Apologies for the length. Hope it's in some way helpful.'
